OSR-search
==========

OSR-search is a simple latent semantic search engine base on the OSR(oline similarity ranking) algorithm, which was invented by me and can mine the latent semantic relationship between the query terms and the documents quickly. the OSR algorithm was inspired by the graph theory and probabilistic model.
